You are working in the existing PRIVATEERS FUTODAMA codebase. The app is functional today; DO NOT change any backend logic, endpoints, agent payloads, extraction flow, scoring/matching logic, or database schema. This task is UI-only (visibility rules) and must not break current working functionality.

PHASE 1A GOAL
Implement a “Demo Mode” flag that ONLY controls what is visible in the UI:
1) Hide internal/lab functionality in the top header (AI Agent selection, Manage AI Agents, Export AI Agent, Advanced Export).
2) Hide the “Batch Processing” navigation/tab (and any entry points) since it is not functional yet.
Nothing else changes in this phase (no page consolidation, no layout changes, no renamed routes).

NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS
- DO NOT modify existing API routes, request payload shapes, response handling, or business logic.
- DO NOT refactor upload flows.
- Keep existing pages/routes available if they exist; this change is conditional rendering only.
- Prefer minimal diffs.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

A) DEMO MODE FLAG (single source of truth)
Create one boolean source of truth for demo mode:
- Preferred: environment variable depending on stack
  - Vite: VITE_DEMO_MODE
  - Next: NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE
  - CRA: REACT_APP_DEMO_MODE
Parse it as boolean (e.g. "true" => true).
If an existing config pattern exists (src/config.ts), integrate there.

B) HIDE INTERNAL HEADER CONTROLS WHEN demoMode = true
Conditionally hide these header elements ONLY:
- AI Agent selection dropdown
- “Manage AI Agents”
- “Export AI Agent”
- “Advanced Export”
Do NOT delete components or routes; just hide the UI elements.

C) HIDE “BATCH PROCESSING” NAV/TAB WHEN demoMode = true
- Remove Batch Processing from visible navigation and any clickable UI.
- Do not remove/disable the underlying page/route if it exists; it should still be accessible in non-demo mode.

D) REGRESSION CHECK
After implementation:
- Job Description Upload still works as before.
- Resume Upload still works as before.
- No console errors.
- demoMode=true hides the lab controls + batch processing everywhere they appear.
- demoMode=false shows the full internal UI exactly like today.

DELIVERABLES
1) Demo mode flag implemented (env/config).
2) Conditional rendering applied to header controls.
3) Conditional rendering applied to navigation for Batch Processing.
4) Small code comment: “Demo Mode hides internal tools for client alpha.”

Proceed with minimal diffs and reuse existing components.
