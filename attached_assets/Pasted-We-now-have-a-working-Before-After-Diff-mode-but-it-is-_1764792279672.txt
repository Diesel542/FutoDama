We now have a working Before/After Diff mode, but it is visually too noisy. We want to keep the full-width diff mode, but make it calmer, more hierarchical, and focused on meaningful changes.

Please implement the following refinements:

A. Section Accordions

1) Wrap each major section in the diff view in a collapsible card:

   Sections:
   - Professional Summary
   - Skills
   - Work Experience
   - Education (if present)

2) Each card header should show:
   - Section title
   - A small change summary, e.g.:
     - “1 rewrite”
     - “6 skills added • 3 de-emphasized”
     - “8 bullets updated • 3 bullets added”

3) Default state:
   - Summary: expanded
   - Skills: expanded
   - Work Experience: collapsed
   - Education: collapsed

4) Clicking the header toggles expand/collapse.

B. Change Focus toggle

5) At the top of the diff mode (under the “Back to Tailoring” header), add:

   Change Focus: [ Key changes ] [ All changes ]

   - Default: "Key changes"
   - "All changes": current behavior (full detailed diffs)
   - "Key changes": hide minor wording tweaks

6) Implement this by adding a similarity threshold when comparing text:

   - For bullets and summary sentences:
     - If original vs tailored text are highly similar (e.g. similarity > 0.8), treat them as unchanged in "Key changes" mode:
       - Render them as normal text with no inline diff.
     - Only show inline diffs in "Key changes" mode when the change is substantial (similarity <= threshold).

C. Softer highlighting

7) Update the diff styling to be less aggressive:

   - For ADDED text:
     - Use normal text color with:
       - a subtle green underline OR a very light green background
       - no big solid blocks
   - For REMOVED text:
     - Use a muted grey-red color with strikethrough
     - no big solid fill backgrounds

8) Ensure unchanged text looks like normal body text (neutral).

D. Skills diff simplification

9) Simplify the skills view:

   - Left column label: "Original skills"
   - Right column label: "Tailored skills"

10) Compute:
    - kept skills: in both original and tailored
    - added skills: only in tailored
    - de-emphasized skills (optional): only in original

11) Render:

    - Original column:
      - Group chips normally.
      - Optionally show a small "De-emphasized" group for skills that only exist on the left.
    - Tailored column:
      - Normal chips for kept skills.
      - For added skills, show a small "+" badge/tag on the chip (e.g. "+").

    - Avoid striking out entire skill chips; the emphasis should be on what was added.

E. Experience diff focusing on structural changes

12) For bullet-level diffing in Work Experience, add a similarity-based filter:

    - When matching originalBullets and tailoredBullets:
      - If a pair of bullets is very similar (mostly rephrasing), treat them as "unchanged" in "Key changes" mode:
        - Render them as normal bullets with no inline diff.
      - If they differ significantly, show the current inline diff.

13) Keep the logic where:
    - Bullets only in tailored -> "added" bullet with a "+" badge at the start.
    - Bullets only in original -> "removed" bullet with a "–" badge at the start and muted styling.

F. Change summary bar

14) At the top of the diff mode, under the main title, compute and display a concise change summary, e.g.:

    "Changes: 1 summary rewrite • 6 skills emphasized • 9 bullets updated • 3 new bullets added"

15) You can derive these counts from the same diff data structures:
    - Number of modified summary segments
    - Number of added/removed skills
    - Number of bullets classified as updated/added/removed

G. Behavior and performance

16) The diff calculations should be reused where possible between "Key changes" and "All changes" modes, to avoid unnecessary recomputation. You can compute a base diff once and then filter it differently based on the selected view.

17) Make sure the diff view continues to behave as a full-width mode that replaces the 3-column layout while active, and that "Back to Tailoring" restores the original tailoring workspace view.

Outcome:
The Before/After Diff mode should still show the same information as before, but in a calmer, more readable form:
- Sections can be expanded/collapsed
- Default view focuses on meaningful changes ("Key changes")
- Colors and highlights are subtle, not overwhelming
- Users can still switch to "All changes" to see the full, detailed diff if desired.
