You can paste this directly:
The current CV Preview is rendered inside the existing right column of the Tailoring Workspace, which makes the A4 preview look squeezed and visually broken near the bottom.

I’d like a proper “preview mode” layout when the Preview tab is selected.

### A. Add a preview mode layout

In the Tailoring Workspace component (the 3-column layout view):

- Introduce a boolean like:

```ts
const isPreviewMode = activeTab === 'preview';



When isPreviewMode is false, keep the current 3-column layout exactly as it is:


Column 1: Target Job


Column 2: Candidate


Column 3: Tailored Output tabs (Resume / Letter / Coverage / ATS)




When isPreviewMode is true, switch to a preview layout:


Hide the old 3-column layout body.


Render a dedicated preview section that spans the main content width under the toolbar/header.




Suggested structure:
if (isPreviewMode) {
  return (
    <div className="tailor-preview-layout">
      {/* top bar still has "Back to Matching" and the job/candidate title context */}
      <PreviewHeaderSummary ... />   // optional, can reuse small bits from Target/Candidate
      <CvPreviewPanel />             // big central A4 preview + template + export buttons
    </div>
  );
}

B. Preview layout styling
Create a layout similar to the Match Workspace:


Full width content container with max-width:


max-width: 1200px;


margin: 0 auto;


padding: 24px;




Inside that, have:


Top row:


left: job + candidate summary (small, single-line or two-line)


right: template dropdown + logo upload + export buttons




Main row:


Centered CV card:






<div className="cv-preview-wrapper">
  <div className="cv-preview-card">
    {/* Render A4 resume preview here */}
  </div>
</div>

CSS-ish guidelines:
.cv-preview-wrapper {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  padding-top: 16px;
  padding-bottom: 32px;
}

.cv-preview-card {
  background: #ffffff;
  color: #111827;
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0 20px 40px rgba(0,0,0,0.35);
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 900px;      /* A4-ish width */
  min-height: 600px;
  padding: 32px;
}



The page should scroll naturally if the CV is long; no clipping or overlapping at the bottom.


C. Reuse existing preview component
The existing preview rendering logic is good – just move it inside the new cv-preview-card instead of squeezing it inside the narrow right column.
The tab behaviour should still be:


In the Tailored Output panel, when switching tabs:


Resume / Letter / Coverage / ATS → normal 3-column mode.


Preview → switch to isPreviewMode = true and render the new layout.




You can keep the tab UI state where it is, just branch the layout rendering based on activeTab.
D. Visual clean-up at the bottom
While you’re there, please ensure:


The Preview layout has a consistent background (same dark workspace background).


The white card has bottom margin so it doesn’t stick to the viewport edge.


No double scrollbars if avoidable – the main page should scroll, not nested containers.


The functional behaviour of tailoring, diff and export should remain unchanged; we’re only changing how the Preview is laid out/resized.

---

Once IT’s done, the test for you:

- Does switching to **Preview** feel like a proper “focus mode” with a big readable CV?
- Does the export still work from this new layout?
- Any jitter when switching back and forth between Preview and the normal tailoring tabs?

When it looks like something you’d happily send to a recruiter on a laptop, we’re good.
