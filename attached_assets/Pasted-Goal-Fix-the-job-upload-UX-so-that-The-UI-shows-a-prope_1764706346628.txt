Goal
Fix the job upload UX so that:
- The UI shows a proper "processing" state while AI extraction runs.
- It stops hammering GET /api/jobs/:id every few milliseconds.
- The job card is only shown when extraction is actually complete.
- "Job Title Not Specified" is not shown during extraction.

A. Backend: explicit processingStatus (if not already present)

1) In the shared Job schema (@shared/schema and DB layer):
   - Add a field like:
     processingStatus: "pending" | "processing" | "completed" | "failed"
   - If such a field already exists, reuse it instead of creating a new one.

2) In the job upload flow (jobFlows / createJobFromUpload etc.):
   - When a job shell is first created from a file/text upload:
     - Set processingStatus = "processing".
   - When AI extraction + validation finish successfully:
     - Set processingStatus = "completed".
   - If the extraction pipeline fails in a terminal way:
     - Set processingStatus = "failed".
     - Optionally store an error message in a separate field (e.g. processingError).

3) Ensure that GET /api/jobs/:jobId returns the processingStatus field so the frontend can see it.

B. Frontend: sensible polling + proper loading state

1) On the Job Description Upload page:
   - After a job is created from an upload, the frontend gets a jobId.
   - Use React Query to fetch the job by jobId, but:
     - Poll at a reasonable interval (e.g. 1000–2000 ms), NOT every 30–40 ms.
     - Example:

       useQuery(["job", jobId], fetchJob, {
         refetchInterval: (data) =>
           data && data.processingStatus === "completed"
             ? false
             : 2000,
       });

   - This stops polling automatically once processingStatus === "completed" (or "failed").

2) UI states for the job card region:

   - If processingStatus === "processing" OR the job has all default/empty values:
     - Do NOT render "Job Title Not Specified" as if it were final.
     - Instead render a clear loading state, for example:
       - Title: "Analyzing job description…"
       - Subtext: "Futodama is extracting requirements, competencies, and context. This may take up to 30 seconds."
       - Optional skeleton placeholders in the job card.

   - If processingStatus === "completed":
     - Render the normal job card with extracted title, overview, requirements, etc.

   - If processingStatus === "failed":
     - Show an error panel:
       - "We couldn’t process this job description."
       - Show a short error message if available (processingError).
       - Offer a "Try again" button that re-triggers processing or lets the user re-upload.

3) Throttle existing polling

   - Wherever the frontend is currently calling GET /api/jobs/:id in a tight loop (as seen by many 304 responses in the logs), replace that with the React Query pattern above.
   - There should be no more high-frequency GET spam; polling every 1–2 seconds is enough.

C. Optional UX niceties (only if time allows)

1) In the AI Agent Status / Processing Logs panel on the Job Upload page:
   - When processingStatus === "processing":
     - Show a live message: "Extraction running for Job [jobId]" or similar.
   - When processingStatus === "completed":
     - Show: "Job extraction completed successfully."
   - When processingStatus === "failed":
     - Show: "Job extraction failed. Please review the input or try again."

2) Ensure the new Match Workspace also respects processingStatus:
   - If a user somehow opens /jobs/:jobId/match while processingStatus !== "completed":
     - Show a banner at the top: "This job is still being processed. Matching will be available once extraction is complete."
     - Either disable Step 1 temporarily or auto-poll until processingStatus === "completed" before allowing matching.

Constraints

- Do not change the structure of the extracted job-card fields beyond adding processingStatus (and optional processingError).
- Keep all existing endpoints and contracts intact; only extend them.
- Keep polling intervals sane (1–2 seconds) and ensure polling stops once processing is done.
