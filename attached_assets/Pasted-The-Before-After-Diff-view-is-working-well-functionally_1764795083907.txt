The Before/After Diff view is working well functionally, but the current colors are too high-contrast and fatiguing to read (especially the bright green additions). Please refine the visual style to make it calmer and more readable without changing any core logic.

A. Added text styling (green is too aggressive)

1) Locate the CSS / Tailwind classes used for added text in the diff view
   (e.g. .diff-token-added or similar).

2) Change the style from “bright green text/blocks” to a much softer accent:
   - Keep the base text color the same as normal body text.
   - Use either:
     - a subtle green underline, OR
     - a very light green background with low opacity.
   - Do NOT use solid green foreground color for the entire word/phrase.

   For example (pseudo-css):
   .diff-token-added {
     color: inherit;
     background-color: rgba(0, 200, 0, 0.10);   // or a theme-appropriate subtle green
     border-radius: 3px;
   }

   Or:
   .diff-token-added {
     color: inherit;
     text-decoration: underline;
     text-decoration-color: rgba(0, 200, 0, 0.6);
   }

   Pick whichever looks more readable with our dark theme, but the key idea is:
   additions should feel like a *hint*, not neon.

B. Removed text styling

3) For removed text (e.g. .diff-token-removed):

   - Keep strikethrough (it’s useful and clear).
   - Use a muted grey-red color instead of strong red.
   - Remove any heavy red background fills if present.

   Example:
   .diff-token-removed {
     color: #b36b6b;              // or another muted tone that fits the theme
     text-decoration: line-through;
     background-color: transparent;
   }

C. General readability (spacing)

4) Slightly increase line-height inside diff blocks to make dense paragraphs easier to scan.

   For the text containers inside each ORIGINAL/TAILORED panel:
   - Increase line-height (e.g. from 1.3 → around 1.5).
   - Ensure there is a bit of vertical spacing between bullets so additions/removals don’t visually merge.

   Example:
   .diff-paragraph {
     line-height: 1.5;
   }

   .diff-bullet {
     margin-bottom: 0.15rem;  // small, but noticeable
   }

D. Keep everything else

5) Do NOT change:
   - Section accordions
   - “Changes: …” summary bar
   - “Change Focus: Key changes / All changes”
   - Matching logic or diff algorithms

   This task is purely visual: soften colors and improve legibility.

6) After updating styles, verify:
   - Additions are clearly visible but not harsh.
   - Removed text is still readable but de-emphasized.
   - Long summary paragraphs are easier to read than before.
