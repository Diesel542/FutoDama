Goal: Add a “Why this match?” section to the CandidateInsightPanel using ExplainabilityV1 (if present), without breaking existing sessions.

Constraints:
- Only modify the MatchWorkspacePage file you pasted (the one containing MatchWorkspacePage, MatchStepsPanel, CandidateInsightPanel).
- Do NOT redesign layout; reuse existing right-side panel.
- Must work even if explainability is missing (older data).

Steps:

1) Add a local type for ExplainabilityV1 in this UI file (minimal copy) OR import it if there is a shared type available.
   Structure needed:
   - overall.verdict: "strong"|"good"|"mixed"|"weak"
   - overall.confidence: number
   - reasons: { code, label, impact, notes?, evidence?[] }
   - warnings?: string[]

2) Extend interface MappedStep2Result to include:
   explainability?: ExplainabilityV1;

3) Update mapStep2FromSchema(result: MatchSessionStep2Result):
   - Include explainability if present on result:
     explainability: (result as any).explainability

4) Update CandidateInsightPanel:
   - At the top, show a Verdict badge next to the score:
     - strong => default badge
     - good => secondary
     - mixed => outline
     - weak => destructive (or outline with amber)
   - If explainability.warnings exists, show them as small outline badges (e.g. LOW_CONFIDENCE, LOW_SCORE).
   - Add a section titled “Why this match?” above Summary:
     - If explainability exists:
       - Render reasons in a compact list:
         - Label + impact badge (high/medium/low)
         - If notes exist, show notes
         - If evidence exists, show up to 1-2 evidence items per reason with job/resume quotes in small italic text
     - If explainability missing:
       - Render a small muted note: “Structured explainability not available for this session.”

5) Keep existing Summary/Strengths/Concerns/Evidence sections unchanged for now.

Acceptance criteria:
- UI shows Verdict + Warnings when explainability exists.
- “Why this match?” renders reasons deterministically.
- No runtime crashes if explainability is missing.
- TypeScript builds.
