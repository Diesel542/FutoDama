The Before/After Diff view is working well structurally, but we need to refine the highlight colors:

- In "Professional Summary" and "Work Experience", the green highlights for added text are now too low-contrast and hard to see.
- In "Skills", the current styling works well and should NOT be changed.

Goal: 
Use a calm blue highlight for added text in the textual sections (summary + experience bullets), keep deletions as they are, and leave the Skills diff styling unchanged.

Please implement the following:

1) Identify the components / CSS classes used in the diff view

We currently have:
- A diff container for each section (Professional Summary, Skills, Work Experience, Education).
- Within those, ORIGINAL and TAILORED panels.
- Added/removed text tokens inside those panels (e.g. classes like `.diff-token-added` / `.diff-token-removed` or similar).

First, locate:
- The wrapper elements that correspond to "Professional Summary" and "Work Experience".
- The classes used for added text tokens INSIDE those sections.

2) Introduce section-aware styles for added text

For the textual sections (“Professional Summary” and “Work Experience”):

- Change the styling of ADDED text tokens inside those sections to use a blue highlight, not green.

Specifically:

- Base text color should remain the normal body text color (no neon blue text).
- The highlight should be a soft blue background with slight padding and border radius.

Example (adjust to match the existing design system):

```css
/* Generic: textual diff highlight */
.diff-text-added {
  color: inherit;
  background-color: rgba(63, 122, 244, 0.20); /* soft blue, tweak if needed */
  padding: 0 2px;
  border-radius: 4px;
}
Now apply this specifically for summary + experience:

css
Copy code
/* Professional Summary section */
.diff-section-summary .diff-token-added {
  composes: diff-text-added;
}

/* Work Experience section */
.diff-section-experience .diff-token-added {
  composes: diff-text-added;
}
If we don’t use composes, just make sure both selectors share the same style block.

The important part is:

Blue background

Normal text color

Subtle, readable highlight

Leave Skills styling as-is

Do NOT change the current styling for skill chips.

If skill additions use something like .skill-chip-added or .diff-skill-added, leave those rules untouched.

If .diff-token-added is currently shared globally, then:

Add MORE SPECIFIC selectors for summary + experience that override the global green.

For example:

css
Copy code
/* Keep this for skills if used there */
.skill-chip-added {
  /* existing green style, unchanged */
}

/* Override only for textual sections */
.diff-section-summary .diff-token-added,
.diff-section-experience .diff-token-added {
  color: inherit;
  background-color: rgba(63, 122, 244, 0.20);
  padding: 0 2px;
  border-radius: 4px;
}
That way:

Skills keep their current green look (which works well in chip form).

Paragraphs and bullets use the calmer blue highlight.

Keep removed text styling

The current removed text (muted + strikethrough) is good. Do NOT change it unless it conflicts with these new rules.

If there is a .diff-token-removed style, keep it as is.

Verify visually

Please test with the current Bo Holch example:

In “Professional Summary”, the TAILORED column should show clearly visible blue-highlighted additions, easy to scan on a dark background.

In “Work Experience”, added / rewritten parts in the TAILORED column should also be clearly visible with blue highlight.

In “Skills”, the chips should look exactly like before (green for added skills, etc.).

The goal is:

Textual sections (summary + experience): blue highlight for additions.

Skills: keep existing styling.

Deletions: unchanged.

If you want a v2 after this (e.g. different intensity for “Key changes” vs “All changes”), we can layer that on top. For now this should make the diff view *much* easier on your eyes while still clearly showing what Futodama changed.
