You are working in the existing PRIVATEERS FUTODAMA codebase. The app is functional today; DO NOT change any backend logic, endpoints, agent payloads, extraction flow, scoring/matching logic, or database schema. This task is UI-only (layout + navigation) and must not break current working functionality.

PHASE 1B GOAL (PERMANENT CHANGE)
Consolidate “Job Description Upload” and “Resume Upload” into a single primary page/tab called “Upload & Compare” (or similar).
This change is NOT controlled by Demo Mode. It should apply for all users/modes.

NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS
- DO NOT change endpoints, payload shapes, or any processing logic.
- Reuse existing components and handlers wherever possible.
- Keep old routes/pages if they exist (optional), but remove them from the main nav so the product feels unified. If keeping routes, ensure they still work and are not broken.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

A) NEW COMBINED PAGE/TAB
Add a new page/tab: “Upload & Compare”.
Layout:
- Two cards/sections side-by-side (responsive stack on small screens):
  LEFT CARD: Job Description
   - Keep file upload (PDF/DOCX) and/or paste text exactly as today.
   - Keep current validation/messages.
  RIGHT CARD: Resume
   - Keep file upload and/or paste text exactly as today.
   - Keep current validation/messages.

B) CTA BEHAVIOR (IMPORTANT)
Preferred:
- One primary CTA at bottom: “Run” / “Run comparison” / “Process with AI”
- Clicking it should trigger the same actions users do today across the two pages.
- Do this by invoking the existing front-end handlers in the correct order without altering payloads.
Fallback (acceptable if single CTA is risky):
- Keep per-card buttons but still unify the page and make the flow obvious (Step 1 + Step 2).
Do NOT change “AI Agent Status” panel in this phase (leave as-is).

C) NAVIGATION
- Replace separate nav items (“Job Description Upload”, “Resume Upload”) with the new combined tab.
- Remove “Job Description Upload” and “Resume Upload” from visible nav.
- If old routes remain, ensure they still render and function (for backward compatibility/internal use), but they should not be the primary entry point.

D) REGRESSION CHECK
- Job description processing still works.
- Resume processing still works.
- Any downstream comparison/matching still works.
- No console errors.

DELIVERABLES
1) New combined “Upload & Compare” page with both upload sections.
2) Nav updated to point to the new combined page.
3) Old pages either removed from nav or routed to the new page (choose minimal-risk approach).
4) No functional changes—UI only.
