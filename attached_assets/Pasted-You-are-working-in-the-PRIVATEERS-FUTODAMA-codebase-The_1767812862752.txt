You are working in the PRIVATEERS FUTODAMA codebase. The app is functional and already visually structured. This task is a FINAL UI POLISH pass only. No logic changes, no behavior changes, no component refactors.

Treat all existing upload components and AI Agent Status components as BLACK BOXES.

GOAL
Apply subtle visual refinements to make the “Upload & Compare” page feel finished and confident, without changing how anything works.

STRICT CONSTRAINTS
- DO NOT change backend logic, handlers, props, or state.
- DO NOT merge or refactor components.
- DO NOT add new behavior, steps, or CTAs.
- Only adjust spacing, hierarchy, contrast, and typography.
- Wrapper-level and CSS-only changes only.

POLISH TASKS

1) DOCUMENTS WRAPPER REFINEMENT
- Slightly reduce the visual weight of the “Documents” wrapper:
  - Make its background one step closer to the page background
  - Keep the border subtle
- Increase internal vertical spacing between Job Description and Resume cards so they breathe more.
- Ensure upload cards visually dominate the wrapper (wrapper should frame, not compete).

2) SECTION HIERARCHY CLEANUP
- “Documents” remains the primary section title.
- “Job Description” and “Resume” should be treated as secondary headers:
  - Slightly smaller font size and/or muted color compared to “Documents”.
- Ensure consistent vertical spacing between section headers and cards (use one spacing token consistently).

3) PROCESSING SIDEBAR MICRO-POLISH
- Strengthen the “Processing” header slightly so it anchors the sidebar:
  - Subtle header background, top border, or stronger contrast (no animations, no logic).
- Reduce visual emphasis of “Active Codex” rows (smaller text or muted color).
- Increase hierarchy of “Processing Logs” label relative to the log box.
- Ensure the empty-state message (“Upload a job description or resume to begin”) sits clearly within the Processing card body, slightly higher, with reduced opacity.

4) BUTTON & INTENT CLARITY (NO BEHAVIOR CHANGE)
- Keep both “Process with AI” buttons as-is.
- Ensure they are visually aligned and consistent.
- Optionally add a subtle helper line above the upload cards:
  “Each document can be processed independently.”
  (Text only, no logic.)

5) FINAL CHECK
- No new empty whitespace or visual imbalance introduced.
- No instructional text floating outside cards.
- No changes to processing behavior.
- Page should feel calm, deliberate, and finished.

DELIVERABLE
- Polished Upload & Compare page with improved hierarchy and cohesion.
- No functional differences from before.
- No console errors.

Proceed conservatively. Small changes only. If in doubt, do less.
