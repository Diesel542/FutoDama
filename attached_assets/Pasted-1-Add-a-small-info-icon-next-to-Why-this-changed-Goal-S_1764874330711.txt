1. Add a small info icon next to “Why this changed”

Goal: Signal that this is a system explanation, not resume content.

Implementation details:

Use a subtle info icon (e.g. Lucide Info or similar)

Color: text-gray-400 (dark mode appropriate)

Size: 14–16px

The icon should not be clickable — purely decorative

Spacing: 4–6px between label and icon

Example layout:

Why this changed   (info icon)

2. Add an expandable/collapsible detailed explanation

Goal: Keep the short rationale always visible, but allow a longer version on demand.

Requirements:

Keep existing short rationale exactly as-is (1–2 sentences)

Add a “Show more” / “Show less” toggle under it

When expanded:

Show a longer explanation (we already have this available in the backend bundle → bundle.rationale.detailed)

Style it with:

slightly smaller text (text-sm)

subtle color (text-gray-300)

soft left border (border-l border-gray-700 pl-3)

Animation: simple height transition (optional)

Default state: collapsed

3. Data model changes (frontend & backend)
Backend

Include two fields in the rationale object:

{
  "rationale": {
    "short": "One-sentence explanation...",
    "detailed": "Longer explanation (2–5 sentences) describing the reasoning behind changes."
  }
}


If detailed is missing, hide the toggle.

Frontend

Update the rationale component to:

Render short always

Render toggle + expanded section only if detailed exists

4. Component structure (React guidelines)

Create a reusable component:

<RationaleBox
  short={rationale.short}
  detailed={rationale.detailed}
/>


This component handles:

Info icon

Short explanation

Show more/less toggle

Expanded detailed explanation

5. UI Styling Requirements (very important)

Must blend seamlessly with current Futodama look

No bright colors, no heavy borders

Keep it elegant, low-contrast, and non-intrusive

Maintain consistent spacing with the rest of the diff section

Deliverables

Updated backend to return short + detailed rationale

Updated frontend rationale component with:

Info icon

Expandable long explanation

Section-level integration across Summary, Skills, Experience
