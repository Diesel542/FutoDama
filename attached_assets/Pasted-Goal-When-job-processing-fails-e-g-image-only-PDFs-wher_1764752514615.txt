Goal
When job processing fails (e.g. image-only PDFs where vision fallback fails), the Job Upload page must show a clear error state instead of looking like it's stalled.

Current behavior
- Backend logs and vision fallback correctly detect failures and log:
  - TEXT_EXTRACTION_TOO_SHORT
  - USING_VISION
  - VISION_FALLBACK_FAILED
  - "We couldn't extract readable text from this job description..."
- POST /api/jobs/upload completes.
- UI shows only "[UPLOAD INITIATED]" and "[JOB CREATED]" in the log panel.
- No error message is shown and no job card appears.

Required changes

A. Make sure the job object exposes failure info
1) Confirm that the job record in storage has:
   - processingStatus: "pending" | "processing" | "completed" | "failed"
   - processingError: string | null    // brief description of the failure

2) Confirm that GET /api/jobs/:jobId returns both fields.

B. React Query handling on Job Upload page

3) The existing useQuery polling for the job by jobId should handle three cases:

   - processingStatus === "processing" (or undefined):
     - Show the "Analyzing job description…" loading state with skeletons.
     - Continue polling every 2 seconds.

   - processingStatus === "completed":
     - Stop polling.
     - Render the normal job card.

   - processingStatus === "failed":
     - Stop polling.
     - Render a clear error state instead of an empty/stalled screen.

4) Error state UI:

   - In the area where the job card normally appears, render a panel with:
     - Title: "We couldn’t process this job description."
     - Body: Either:
       - The processingError string, if available, OR
       - A generic message:
         "We couldn’t extract readable text from this job description. If this is a scanned image or screenshot, please upload a text-based PDF or paste the job description text directly."
     - A "Try again" secondary button that:
       - Clears the current jobId and resets the form, so the user can upload again or paste text.

   - The processing log panel should also show the last error line, e.g.:
     - "[ERROR] We couldn’t extract readable text from this job description. If this is a scanned image or screenshot, please upload a text-based PDF or paste the job description text directly."

C. Log stream alignment

5) If the Job Upload page subscribes to a log/stream endpoint:
   - Ensure that when the server logs a structured error for the job (e.g. VISION_FALLBACK_FAILED), that message is appended to the Processing Logs panel.
   - The UI should not silently disconnect without showing the error.

Outcome

- For text-based PDFs: behavior stays as-is (success, job card rendered).
- For image-only PDFs in the Replit environment:
  - The user sees a **clear explanation** of why it failed, not a stalled screen.
  - There is a visible suggestion to paste the text or use a text-based PDF.
- No dependency names (ImageMagick, Ghostscript) are exposed in the UI.
